# NumericalMethods-App
An android app to use various Numerical Analysis methods to solve equations we encounter in physics.

I have implemented root finding methods as a start, namely Bisection Method, Newton Raphson Method and method of Regula Falsi.
The result is generated as a table of different parameters, which becomes convenient to check your own answers when doing by other medium.


****Credtis for resources****
I have used this beautiful Mathematical Library named MXParser for JAVA which provides most of the mathematical functions barring some.
